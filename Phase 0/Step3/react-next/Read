This project is part of Phase 0 – Step 3 of my internship learning program.
The task focuses on understanding the basics of React, Next.js, and TypeScript.

A simple Lyric Sheet component is created to display a song title and lyrics.

- Learn React components and props
- Understand Next.js page routing
- Use TypeScript for type safety
- Build a reusable UI component

- React.js
- Next.js
- TypeScript
- Tailwind CSS

components/
- LyricSheet.tsx

pages/
- index.tsx

The LyricSheet component is a reusable React component that receives a Song object as a prop.
The Next.js page (index.tsx) creates the Song object and passes it to the component.

This task helped in understanding how React components work inside a Next.js application using TypeScript.
