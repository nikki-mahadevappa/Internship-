This task was all about Createing github repository and git commands practice 

1. I created a new GitHub repository named "Lyric-Verse-AI".
2. I cloned the repository into my local system using the git clone command.
3. I created a new file named vision.md and added my project vision into it.
4. I added the file to the staging area using git add.
5. I committed the changes using git commit -m "Add vision.md".
6. I linked my local project with the remote GitHub repository using git remote add origin.
7. Finally, I pushed all my changes to GitHub using git push.

You can view the repository here: [Lyric-Verse-AI](https://github.com/nikki-mahadevappa/Lyric-Verse-AI)
